# week2

okay so week 2s assesment,

first thoughs i wont lie I am scared of the big JS, mainly i get a lil anxiety before starting it, but ima just start off with my html and css and cross that bridge when I get too it

html boilerplate done, styles and scripts linked and script has been deffered to load at the end for quicker websites and so it renders correctly,

html seems done i hope
added logo and a div with my images, alt tags added too for the accessibilty aspect, 

side note - alt + z for wordwrap, knew it off by heart lowkey happy hahahaha something so small but just a reminder that I am learning even passively! :)

okay css time and some basic theming gonna use the body, html tags as i learnt from last project when i ran into that knowlege gap and found out i can target the body and the whole html element, i remmeber syaing the solution is so simple in hindsite and how true that was!

i genuinely love how you can refer to what you want when you know what your doing saves alot of time ! for example .image-gallery img attacks only my images and not my div, lovely stuff,

added hover and made it smooth using w3 sites, i knew about the hover just wanted to make a transition,

first hurdle, trying to move all the images slightly right so they properly centered, justify content not working, neither as margin or anything i try, stackoverflow time i guess, manage to fix myself, I was adding the margin left to the images rather than the div itself lol silly me 

time to research image queries, lucky me brb dawg,

also in the html -   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

does this not handle everything in regards to different screen sizes? i understand media queires makes buttons smaller etc but could you explain in the feedback of a real life example where it would be crucial?

downloaded a neat mobileview extention to check my code and it looks good!! my images were off centre but justify contenr solved it im actually quite happy how this is coming along!

hmmm its nice and centred on pixel but not iphone, wtf why?? i hate iphone, i hate apple, this is just annoying and proves why android is on top, but lets see if i can fix this,

i tried a million and 1 methods nothing works ill be here for another hour time to move on. but its looks all good on android so... ios can go to hell, im sorry.

JS time, after an hour of research i wont lie im kinda getting the hang of it,

that took way too long. -.-

ooo now that i updated it with js ios started to kinda work woohoo!

could do with a bit of help and some self revision on it would do me some good maybe even like an extra javascript class if thats a thing
